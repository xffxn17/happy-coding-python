# variables
x = 10  # here x value is 10
y = 20
print(x + y)
print(x)
print(y)
x = 15  # now x value is changed to 15
print(x)
# so same can be used to store different values
# but at a time a variable can store only one value
# the place where i printed x it will print the value of x at that time
# so first time it printed 10 and second time it printed 15
