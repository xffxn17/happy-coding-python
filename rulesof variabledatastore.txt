To store data in a variable, Python has the following rules:
- Variable names can contain letters (A to Z, a to z), digits (0 to 9), and the underscore (_).
- Variable names cannot start with a digit.
- No symbols other than underscore are allowed.
- Variable names cannot contain spaces.

Examples:
num = Affan      (valid)
num = 1Affan     (invalid, cannot start with a number)
roll_no          (valid)
_rollno          (valid)
rollno1          (valid)
roll_1no         (valid)
If we declare Num and then try to print(num), it will show an error because variable names in Python are case-sensitive; 
you must use the exact same name as declared.

If we are not assigning any value to a variable, we should write 'None' in it. 
This means the variable exists but does not hold any specific value yet.

Example:
my_variable = None  # This variable is declared but has no value assigned

# Later, you can assign a value to it
my_variable = 10
print(my_variable)  # Output: 10
